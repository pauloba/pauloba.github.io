At the beginning of each stage, the player sitting to the right of the stage starter may place the referee camel on any free space on the track. If a camel unit ends its movement on the referee camel's space, all camels in this unit are asked to “unstack” and line up next to each other on this space. The camels are “unstacked” from top to bottom and lined up in the same order from left to right. (The top camel is therefore on the far left, at the outer edge of the playing field, and is considered to be the furthest forward). As soon as the camels have been “unstacked” (or a single camel has landed on the field), the referee camel is removed from the track and placed next to the game board. It is not used again until the start of the next stage. If a camel unit lands on a field of camels that have already been unstacked, it jumps onto the camel furthest to the left."
