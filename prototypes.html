      <h4 id=me>Game prototyping</h4>

      <p>I am in the middle of designing a very simple board game based on mechanics I've learnt while playing other board games with my friends.</p>
      
      <p>This is something I've been wanting to do for a long time, but never really commited to book time for it.</p>
      
      <p>This project is in very early stages and I will be posting updates here.</p>
